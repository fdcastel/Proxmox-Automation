# Proxmox VE automation scripts

Collection of scripts to manage Proxmox environments.

Please read section [Using Docker on LXC](#using-docker-on-lxc) if you are planning to use Docker with Linux Containers (LXC).

To migrate an existing Windows VM from Hyper-V to Proxmox see [this other project](https://github.com/fdcastel/Hyper-V-Automation#windows-prepare-a-vhdx-for-qemu-migration) (for Windows) first.



# How to install

To download all scripts into a temporary folder:

```bash
source <(curl -Ls https://bit.ly/p-v-a)
```

This will download and execute [bootstrap.sh](bootstrap.sh). It will also install `unzip` apt package.

## download-cloud-image

```
Usage: ./download-cloud-image.sh <url> [OPTIONS]
    <url>                Url of image to download.
    --no-clobber, -nc    Doesn't overwrite an existing image.
    --help, -h           Display this help message.
```

Downloads an image from given `url` into `/var/lib/vz/template/iso/` folder. 

If the image already exists it will not be downloaded again.

If the file is compressed with `gz`, `xz` or `zip` it will also uncompress it.

Returns the full path of downloaded image.

### Example

```bash
# Download Ubuntu 22.04 LTS image

Creates a VM from a cloud image.

You can use any image containing `cloud-init` and `qemu-guest-agent` installed.

Additionally, you can use `--install-docker` to also install `docker` into virtual machine (currently implemented only for Ubuntu). 

Any additional arguments are passed to `qm create` command. Please see [`qm` command documentation](https://pve.proxmox.com/pve-docs/qm.1.html) for more information about the options.

### Example

```bash
# Download Ubuntu 22.04 LTS image
URL='https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/releases/jammy/release/ubuntu-22.04-server-cloudimg-amd64.img'
UBUNTU_IMAGE_FILE=$(./download-cloud-image.sh $URL --no-clobber)

# Creates an Ubuntu VM with "my-key.pub" ssh key and Docker installed.
VM_ID=201
./new-vm.sh $VM_ID --image $UBUNTU_IMAGE_FILE --name 'vm-ubuntu' --sshkey '~/.ssh/my-key.pub' --install-docker

# Using Docker on LXC

The following is a compilation about the subject I found around the net. Please read if you wish to follow this path.



## Overview

**Using Docker on LXC is not recommended by Proxmox team.** However, certain features of LXC like reduced memory usage and bind mount points between containers and host may be an incentive to go against this recommendation.

Two discussions about the pros and cons of each alternative may be found [here](https://forum.proxmox.com/threads/proxmox-7-1-and-docker-lxc-vs-vm.105140) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/xno101/using_multiple_lxc_vs_multiple_lxcdocker_vs/).



## ZFS

Using Docker _over ZFS storage_ causes an additional burden: It will use [`vfs` driver](https://docs.docker.com/storage/storagedriver/vfs-driver/) by default, which is terribly inefficient.

To check what storage driver Docker is currently using, use `docker info` and look for the `Storage Driver` line:
```bash
$ docker info

<...>
Storage Driver: vfs
<...>
```

To avoid this, you have 3 options:

  - use [`fuse-overlayfs`](https://github.com/containers/fuse-overlayfs)
  - use [`zfs` storage driver](https://docs.docker.com/storage/storagedriver/zfs-driver/)
  - use `overlay2` storage driver

To make a long story short, I did not find any successful report of the two first options.

`overlay2` is a [stable and recommended driver](https://docs.docker.com/storage/storagedriver/select-storage-driver/) but only works with `xfs` and `ext4` filesystems.

This did not not stop [u/volopasse](https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/lsrt28/comment/goubt7u/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) some years ago to find a workaround: to create a sparse zfs volume formatted as `ext4` and use it as a bind mount point for `/var/lib/docker`. This will make Docker use `overlay2` without any changes needed in Docker configuration.

It may seem a hack (which it is) but it [reportedly works better than the very own Docker ZFS driver](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/31247#issuecomment-611976248).

All these steps are wrapped into [`new-ct-docker-volume.sh`](new-ct-docker-volume.sh) script, which is also used by [`new-ct.sh`](new-ct.sh) script when invoked with `--install-docker` option.

From my personal experience: I am using this solution for more than a year now in my home servers with zero problems of performance nor stability. That said I do not use nor recommend this solution in any production capacity. Also, see [Caveats](#caveats) section below.



## Caveats when using Docker on LXC

### Backups

Backups (both to local storage and to Proxmox Backup Server) works fine.

However, please note that **the contents of `/var/lib/docker` will not be included in backups**.

Because of this you should not use [Docker volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) to store any persistent data which is important since they will be kept at this location (and, again, will **not** be included in backups). 

Instead you should use [Docker bind mounts](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/) which mounts a file or directory from the Docker host (LXC, in our case) into a Docker container. All files from LXC filesystem will be included into backups.

Lastly, since we are talking about backups, please remember again that all this is very new and _not recommended by Proxmox team_. I put these scripts initially for my personal usage and they have yet a long way to run until be considered stable and battle-tested. Thus, caution is advised.



### Restoring backups

To restore an existing backup you _must_ use [restore-ct](#restore-ct) script with the `--restore-docker` option. This will rebuild the `zfs` volume for `/var/lib/docker` and mount it correctly.

Simply using the _Restore_ command from Proxmox Web UI will fail since it doesn't know what to do with `/var/lib/docker/` bind mount point. 



### Migrations & Snapshots

Originally this method caused migrations and snapshot to fail.

[iGadget](https://github.com/alexpdp7/ansible-create-proxmox-host/issues/1#issue-1492924235) found that naming the ZFS volume in a very specific way solves the snapshot and migration problems. This naming scheme is already adopted by these scripts so, for now, migrations and snapshots are working.

However, please be aware that this takes advantage of a very specific way Proxmox was implemented and it may break in future Proxmox versions.
